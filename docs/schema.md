## Resource Framework — Schema Reference

This section lists the core TypeScript types that make up the Resource Framework, with concise examples for each. It’s split across four pages:

- Routes and registries: see [Schema — Routes](./schema/01-routes.md)
- Field specs and built columns: see [Schema — Fields](./schema/02-fields.md)
- Column constructors and registry: see [Schema — Constructors](./schema/03-constructors.md)
- Hooks: see [Schema — Hooks](./schema/04-hooks.md)

Each page includes:

- A minimal type signature for quick scanning
- A short example demonstrating typical usage
