# Overview

Build resource lists, drilldowns, and schema-driven forms quickly. Keep UI/routing decoupled via adapters.

- Resource: table/view exposed in UI
- Routes: list and drilldown configuration
- Columns: rendering and editing hints
- Filters: consistent operators → server
- Forms: multi-step, schema-driven flows
- Hooks: filters, preferences, scopes
