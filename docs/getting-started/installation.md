# Installation

```bash
npm install resource-framework
```

Peer dependencies expected in your app:

- react >= 18, react-dom >= 18
- @tanstack/react-table ^8
- Optional (used by some cells/components): date-fns, react-error-boundary, lucide-react, md5

If you only use headless APIs (constructors, utils, hooks), UI peers are optional.
